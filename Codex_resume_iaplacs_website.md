- Thread ID: `019f472c-9bd3-7222-9160-5fa0162a1249`

- Working directory: `/Users/xiaoxiaotu/_01_IAP/Website`

## User Goal

The user bought `iaplacs.xyz` on Alibaba Cloud/万网 and wants to build a website backed by data on an IAP server. The long-term product should resemble a professional weather forecast service, but with a more modern, calm, technology-oriented research-institute style.

## Current State

- Workspace was empty at the start of this thread.
- Workspace is not a Git repository.
- Created a Step 0 planning document with deployment architecture, domain/备案 path, data publishing model, server inspection checklist, and visual/product direction.
- Answered an ICP filing form question: Alibaba Cloud 备案服务码 only applies when the website/App is hosted on an eligible Alibaba Cloud mainland China resource. If the Beijing IP is not an Alibaba Cloud mainland resource, the user should file through the real server/access provider instead of trying to use Alibaba Cloud's service code.
- Clarified how to find an Alibaba Cloud ICP 备案服务码: if the user only bought the domain, there is no service code; if they bought an eligible Alibaba Cloud mainland ECS/轻量服务器, check the ICP filing console/service-code management console or let the filing flow auto-generate it when the server and filing account are the same.
- Clarified that if the user has no Alibaba Cloud server, they cannot fill an Alibaba Cloud ICP service code. They must either buy an eligible Alibaba Cloud mainland server/resource, or file through the real server/access provider. For the intended IAP-LACS public forecast/data service, personal filing may be inappropriate; unit/事业单位 filing is likely the better long-term route.
- Clarified OSS filing implications: Alibaba Cloud OSS custom domains require ICP filing when used for website/static-file access, but OSS is not the same as an eligible ECS/轻量服务器 for obtaining the standard ICP service code. If the website source server is not Alibaba Cloud, file through the source server access provider; OSS custom-domain备案 does not solve the service-code requirement for a non-Alibaba source server.
- Clarified static-site feasibility: static vs dynamic does not determine ICP filing. Filing depends mainly on whether the domain resolves to or uses a mainland China server/cloud resource. A fully static site can avoid buying a VM by using static hosting, but if hosted on mainland resources or mainland CDN/custom domains, ICP filing is still required.
- Added the current lightweight route: use GitHub Pages for the MVP site, optionally store images directly in the Pages repo at first, and move images to object storage/CDN later if image volume or traffic exceeds GitHub Pages' practical limits.
- Clarified GitHub Pages site count: one account can have only one user/organization site such as `<owner>.github.io`, but can have many project sites, one per repository, such as `<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`. Each project site can act as a separate static blog/site.

## Important Changed Files

- `/Users/xiaoxiaotu/_01_IAP/Website/IAPLACS_website_step0_plan.md`
- `/Users/xiaoxiaotu/_01_IAP/Website/Codex_resume_iaplacs_website.md`

## Verification Commands and Results

```bash
pwd
```

Result: `/Users/xiaoxiaotu/_01_IAP/Website`

```bash
ls -la
```

Result at start: empty directory except `.` and `..`.

```bash
git status --short
```

Result: `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`

Official references checked during planning:

- Alibaba Cloud DNS add-record documentation.
- Alibaba Cloud ICP filing service page.
- National public security internet filing portal.
- Certbot Nginx instructions.

## Known Pitfalls

- If the target server is in mainland China and `iaplacs.xyz` resolves to it, ICP filing is required before normal public access.
- If the IAP server is an internal research/data machine, avoid exposing it directly. Prefer a public Web gateway/ECS and scheduled data push.
- In Alibaba Cloud ICP filing, do not confuse `主体所在地` with the server IP location. `主体所在地` should follow the organizer's real certificate/address. A Beijing server/IP only affects server/access information.
- Owning the domain at Alibaba Cloud/万网 does not by itself provide an Alibaba Cloud ICP service code. The service code comes from an eligible Alibaba Cloud mainland server/resource.
- Alibaba Cloud docs state same-account filing generally auto-generates the service code during filing; different account filing requires service-code authorization from the server owner account, and personal-authenticated accounts cannot authorize service codes to others.
- If the project represents IAP/LACS research data or public forecast services, avoid presenting it as a purely personal website unless the content is genuinely personal. Domain holder, filing主体, website name, and actual content should match.
- Alibaba Cloud OSS documentation says both the website domain resolving to a mainland server and an OSS-bound custom domain used for static files need ICP filing; if the source site is not on Alibaba Cloud, the source server access provider handles the filing and Alibaba Cloud access is not mandatory.
- Static hosting can satisfy an MVP forecast-display site if all products are pre-rendered to Web-friendly files such as manifest JSON, images, tiles, and compressed JSON, then uploaded on a schedule. It becomes insufficient only when the site needs authenticated users, server-side computation, heavy querying, or real-time APIs.
- GitHub Pages official limits as checked on 2026-07-09: source repository recommended limit 1 GB, published site no larger than 1 GB, soft bandwidth limit 100 GB/month, and rate limiting may apply. This is acceptable for a low-traffic image-based MVP but not for heavy public image distribution.
- GitHub Pages official docs as checked on 2026-07-09: maximum one user/organization Pages site per account and maximum one project Pages site per repository.
- Do not send raw large NetCDF/GRIB/MICAPS files directly to browsers. Generate Web-friendly manifests, images, tiles, GeoJSON, or compressed JSON.
- Use atomic publish directories so failed data updates do not break the live site.
- HTTPS via Certbot usually requires the HTTP site to be reachable on port 80, unless using DNS validation.

## Next Recommended Actions

1. Confirm whether the IAP server has a public IPv4 and whether ports 80/443 may be opened.
2. Run the server inspection commands from `IAPLACS_website_step0_plan.md`.
3. Decide deployment topology:
   - Direct deployment on IAP server if allowed.
   - Public ECS/轻量服务器 plus scheduled push from IAP server if the IAP server should remain internal.
4. Identify first MVP products and data paths: forecast maps, station time series, observation/radar/satellite layers, or model output.
5. Build a minimal Nginx test page, point DNS after备案/合规条件 are satisfied, then add HTTPS.
